# Assets

**Logo (required):** Place the FGEHA emblem here as **logo.png**. It is used for:

- App icon (iOS, Android, web)
- Splash screen
- Login, Register, Pending, Home, and New Request screens

**New emblem:** The circular FGEHA emblem (dark green on black, with “FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES HOUSING AUTHORITY” and Urdu text) should be copied to **`logo.png`** in this folder. Splash and Android adaptive icon use a black background (`#000000`) to match the emblem.

**How to update the logo:**
1. Copy your logo file (e.g. the 18-02-2020_LOGO_hr image) into this folder.
2. Rename it to **logo.png** (or overwrite the existing `logo.png`).
3. Restart the app / rebuild if you changed the app icon or splash.

Optional separate assets (if you want different images per use):
- **icon.png** – 1024×1024 app icon (default: same as logo.png)
- **favicon.png** – Web favicon (default: same as logo.png)
