# Request type icons

Icons for the Home screen categories (Garbage, Water, Electricity, Sewerage, Others).

**Generated icons (copy into this folder if needed):**
- `garbage-icon.png` – green trash can, waste issues
- `water-icon.png` – blue water droplet, water supply
- `electricity-icon.png` – lightbulb with lightning, power issues
- `sewerage-icon.png` – pipe and drainage
- `others-icon.png` – house with wrench/screwdriver, other civic issues

If the image tool saved them under your project’s `assets` folder, move or copy those PNGs here. You can then use them in the app as local assets, or upload them in the admin per request type (Request types → Edit → Upload icon).
